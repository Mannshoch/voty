# Contributing to voty

### voty.ch is Open Source üéâ

voty.ch is developed under the open source [AGPL-3.0 License](www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) and you are more than welcome to contribute to this project.

### Feedback

The most valuable feedback in this early time of the project is feedback! Please reach out the the project team https://voty.ch/kontakt with all your feedback on what you like about voty.ch or where you see room for improvement. We are always grateful for feedback üôè.

### Current State of the Project

Be aware though, that at this point in time, we are in a rapid prototyping phase and most edges are still rough. We lack documentation on installation instructions or more, so you will be able to help yourself or post an [issue](https://github.com/teachen-ch/voty/issues) with your question.

### Contributing Content

We will try to host most of the actual learning content on github.com itself as Markdown files (see https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/ for an introduction to Markdown).

This should make it feasible for contributors without a coding background to propose changes on our content, so that we can work collaboratively on it.

### Political Views

voty.ch should teach young people how politics work in Switzerland. But in order to stay credible and releveant it needs to be absolutely neutral and not favor a specific political viewpoint. If you feel like some content in the project does favor a viewpoint, then please give us feedback by raising an [issue](https://github.com/teachen-ch/voty/issues) or by directly contributing your change to the codebase (see above)
